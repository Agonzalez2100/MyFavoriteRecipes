# MyFavoriteRecipes
A simple web-page using HTML and CSS. The content and most of the design is based on an EdX tutorial, but I wrote the code.

I got to practice positioning, links, some styling, and making pages more dynamic using CSS pseudo-classes. There is plenty more I could add now, such as adding an aside box, 
formatting the recipes into columns, and so on.
